# From-StableDiffusion-to-Computer-Generated-Holograph

This repository has been established for a pipeline that integrates a stable diffusion model with computer-generated holography. The system creates holography in response to specified prompts.

To evaluate the pipeline, you will need to run the setup cell once, a process that may take between five to ten minutes. After the environmental requirements have been met, you can experiment with prompt inputs and observe the corresponding holographic outputs.
